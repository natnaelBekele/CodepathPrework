## Reflection Questions

1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.
   
   * [w3schools.com]
   * [stackoverflow]
   * [youtube]
   * [Udemy.com]

    

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)
   [Since I do not have much background with JavaScript, I had a little trouble understanding the syntax. However, I understood some of it by going over the developer documentation, watching some YouTube videos, and referencing w3school. I was also having some issues while I was recording my gif file; it was my PC setting, I solved it after I watched some videos. In addition, after finishing the project, I spent some time studying the conditions in the if-else statements to have a better understanding of them. While I had the necessary structure for the if-else statements, I did not have the appropriate conditions in the statement.]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)
  * [What are the latest tools used to develop a website?]
  * [Are HTML, CSS, and javascript enough to build good webpages?]
  * [How it looks like working in a company as a junior web developer?]
  * [How is testing accomplished for websites?]
  * [What makes the connection of the website to the back end?]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   [I want to add some additional features and rearrange the page layout to make it look more interesting. I would like to insert a hidden background image for each button, and I also want to give the user some extra chance, and I want to add levels by making the change of the color pattern faster each time the user guesses correctly. In addition I want to add some three dimantion congratulation message. ]
